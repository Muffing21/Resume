# What is this program?
### This program is about the Huffman Coding algorithm.
### 2 main files, Encode.c and Decode.c and that is there you will use io.c and building trees and such to hopefully compress and uncompress files.

# How to use your program and Makefile?
### to run the program run this into the command line

###This applies to both the encoder and decoder.
###-h: prints out a help message
###-v : Print compression statistics to stderr.
###-i <input> : Specify input file to compress (stdin by default)
###-o <output> : Specify output file to write the compressed input to(stdout by default)
###So an example would be something like: ./encode -i random.txt -o decoded -v

#How to use Makefile?
###make (to compile)
###make clean
###make format
