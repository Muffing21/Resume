# What is the program about?

### The program is about sorting. There are 4 types of sorting in this assignment. Heap sort, Quick sort, Insert sort and Shell sort. The program will ask you to input which kind of sorting algorithm to use and feel free to specify the number of elements, seed, and the number of elements to print. If not specified, default values will be used instead.

# How to build the program?

### there are several files you have to keep track of. Make sure that in the folder you have stats.h, heap.h, insert.h, quick.h, set.h, shell.h. If you have those files, make sure to link them all with your makefile to make ./sorting work.

#How to run the program?
###compile and in your command prompt you can type something like ./sorting -a which whill print all types of sorts



# command-line options?

### -a enables all sorting algorithms
### -e enables heap sort
### -i enables insertion sort
### -s enables shell sort
### -q enables quicksort
### -r set the random seed to seed.
### -n set the array size. The default size should be 100
### -p print out number of elements from the array. The default number of elements to print out should be 100
### if the size of the array is less than the specified number of elements to print, print out the entire array and nothing more
