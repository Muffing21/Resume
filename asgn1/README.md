# What Does the program do?

The program is designed to take user input of number of players and the seed number. Then, the program will play out the "Pass the Pigs" game. It will output the current player rolling the pig, what they rolled, and lastly the winner with the amount of points they have.



## How to build the program?

I thought about how there will definitely be a while loop needed because all we have to do is loop between players until we find a winner. Also keep track by having a few counters. The only thing we have to be aware of is when a player rolls a side, we will have to change players. Other than that, each player take turns rolling the pig and the score counter must be updated each time the pig is rolled. Constantly check for a winner.

### How to run the program?

go into your command prompt and change directory until you are in the same folder as the pig.c. Now simply compile the pig file and type ./pig then enter the number of players and seed to run the program.
